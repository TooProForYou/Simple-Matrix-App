## ✨ Features

The application is divided into two main mathematical categories:

### 1. Basic Operations
Perform element-wise or dot-product arithmetic between your primary matrix and:
- **Scalars:** Addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication.
- **Vectors/Matrices:** Addition, subtraction, and matrix multiplication.

### 2. Advanced Operations
Evaluate matrix properties or generate derived matrices:
- **Determinant & Singularity:** Calculate the determinant and check if a matrix is singular (non-invertible).
- **Transpose:** Swap rows and columns.
- **Symmetry:** 
  - Check if a matrix is symmetric or skew-symmetric.
  - Convert a matrix into a symmetric matrix.
  - Randomly generate symmetric or skew-symmetric matrices of any size.
- **Inverse & Adjoint:** Compute the multiplicative inverse and adjoint matrices.
- **Cofactor Matrix:** Generate the matrix of cofactors.
- **Rank:** Determine the linear independence of the matrix rows/columns.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**: Required for the structural pattern matching (`match`/`case`) utilized in the script.
- **NumPy**: Used for core matrix calculations and linear algebra functions.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Install the required dependency using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## 💻 Usage & Input Formatting

Run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python matrix_app.py
```

### ⚠️ How to Input Matrices
The application uses Python's `ast.literal_eval` to safely parse your text input into an array. **You must use standard Python list-of-lists syntax.** 

- **3x3 Matrix:** `[[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5]]`
- **2x2 Matrix:** `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
- **1x3 Vector:** `[[1, 2, 3]]`

> **Note:** Ensure all brackets are properly opened and closed, and separated by commas.

## 🧮 Operations Guide

Once the app is running, you will be greeted by the main menu:

1. **Exit** - Closes the application.
2. **Basic Operations** - Prompts you for a matrix, then asks if you want to operate against a scalar or another vector/matrix.
3. **Advanced Operations** - Prompts you for a matrix, then provides a sub-menu for advanced linear algebra computations (Inverse, Rank, Adjoint, etc.). 

*The app will loop continuously until you type `no` when asked "Do you want to stay?" at the end of an operation cycle.*

## 🗺️ Update Noted

- [ ] **"Remember Me" Matrix Memory:** Variables (`memory`, `s`) are finally worked upon and have reached the end of development and the application has achieved a binary memory feature.
- [ ] **Enhanced Error Handling:**  This has finally rolled out and now exception catching for non-square matrices during operations like Adjoint and Cofactor generation to prevent unexpected crashes has been optimized well.
